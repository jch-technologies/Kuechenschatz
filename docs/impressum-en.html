                    By purchasing a subscription, you do not acquire an app, software or other goods, 
                    but a license to use the premium features of this app. The license is generally 
                    non-transferable, with the following exceptions:

                <ul>

                    Subscriptions <strong>automatically renew</strong> unless cancelled at least 
                    <strong>24 hours before the end</strong> of the current period. 
                    Renewal occurs at the same price and for the same duration as the original subscription.

                <h4>Cancellation</h4>
                <p>
                    Subscriptions can only be cancelled through the <strong>App Store Settings</strong>:

                </ul>
                <p>
                    Cancellation within the app is not technically possible. After cancellation,
